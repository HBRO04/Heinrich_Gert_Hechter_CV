## Profile  
I am currently a third-year Information Technology student at North-West University. From a young age, I have been passionate about working with computers, which naturally led me to develop a strong interest in programming. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects, often challenging myself to build new applications and explore different technologies. I am a fast learner, eager to expand my knowledge, and always open to learning new skills and refining my existing ones.
